# AI Manager

**Empowering Music Artists and Professionals with Robust AI-Driven Knowledge & Strategy**

---

## üöÄ Vision & Goals

- **Personal Manager Persona:** Provide each user with an AI assistant that blends personal knowledge (uploaded docs, notes, history) and global industry intelligence for world-class advice.
- **Robust, Scalable RAG:** Use the latest retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for context-aware, accurate, and explainable answers.
- **Hybrid Semantic Search:** Maximize recall and relevance by combining multiple embedding models and knowledge bases.
- **Privacy & Security:** Strictly isolate personal data and audit all knowledge access.
- **Observability:** Maintain full traceability and logging for all retrieval and reasoning steps.

---

## üß† System Overview

### Core Components
- **Backend (Python):** Orchestrates ingestion, semantic search, intent classification, context retrieval, and LLM prompt construction.
- **Frontend (Streamlit):** Modern, responsive UI for document upload, chat, and analytics.
- **Qdrant Vector DB:** Stores all chunked knowledge with embeddings from multiple models.
- **OpenAI API:** Provides embeddings and LLM completions.

---

## üîé Hybrid Retriever: How & Why

### **Knowledge Bases (KBs):**
- **Personal KB:** User-specific docs, only accessible by that user (filtered by `user_id`).
- **Global KB:** Industry-wide docs, best practices, and general info (never filtered by `user_id`).

### **Hybrid Multi-Embedding Search:**
- For every query, generate embeddings using:
  - OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`)
  - BGE (`bge-base-en-v1.5`)
  - B2M5
- Query Qdrant for each embedding across all relevant KBs.
- Merge and deduplicate results by chunk.

### **KB Targeting Logic:**
| Query Intent | KBs Targeted         | Filtered by user_id? | Why?                                 |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| personal     | personal, global    | personal only        | Personalization + industry context   |
| global       | global              | never                | Industry context only                |
| hybrid       | personal, global    | personal only        | Both personal and industry blended   |

- **Personal KB**: Only if query is personal/hybrid **and** user is authenticated.
- **Global KB**: Always targeted for every query.

## üß© Implementation Details

### Ingestion
- Chunk documents using token overlap.
- Generate and store embeddings for all supported models.
- Store in Qdrant with appropriate KB and user_id.

### Retrieval
- Classify query intent (LLM-based, fallback to keywords).
- For each embedding model, search all relevant KBs.
- Merge/deduplicate results.
- Build prompt with clear context source separation.

### Security & Privacy
- Personal KBs are always filtered by user_id.
- Global KBs are never filtered by user_id.
- All access and retrievals are logged.
- No sensitive data in logs.

### Logging & Observability
- Structured logs to `logs/ai_manager.log` (see `logging.conf`).
- All major retrieval, classification, and LLM steps logged.
- Errors and fallbacks are traceable.

### Deployment & Setup
- Requires Python 3.10+, Docker, and Docker Compose.
- Environment variables:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_COLLECTION`
- Start with: `docker-compose up --build`
- Frontend at `localhost:8501`, backend at `localhost:8000`

### Test Cases & Quality
- Test classification, retrieval, and ingestion.
- Example:
  - `test_classify_intent`: Ensures correct intent detection.
  - `test_retrieve_context`: Ensures correct KB targeting and context retrieval.
  - `test_prompt_building`: Ensures context is separated and prompt is well-formed.
- Use Django test runner: `docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test`

---

## üèÜ Alignment with Vision
- **Personalization:** Each user gets tailored, private, and industry-aware answers.
- **Robustness:** Hybrid search ensures no relevant context is missed.
- **Transparency:** All KB targeting and context selection is explainable and logged.
- **Scalability:** Modular, multi-KB, multi-embedding design supports future growth.
- **Maintainability:** All logic and workflows are documented and testable.

---

## üìö Onboarding Checklist
- Clone repo, set up `.env` with required keys.
- Ingest your documents (re-ingest if upgrading to hybrid search).
- Start all services with Docker Compose.
- Use the chat and analytics dashboard.
- Review logs for troubleshooting.
